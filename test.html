    <h1>Wolfgang Weingart </h1>

    How did Wolfgang Weingart become the father off New Wave typography? 
    
 
    
    
   <h2 id="introduction">introduction </h2>
    
   <p>Wolfgang Weingart was a German designer, Author and teacher who was known for pioneering the “new wave “Swiss aesthetic graphic design. 
    Using his graphic design and using the school for printing press helped him become enrolled at Basel school of art in Switzerland in 1964. 
    (Jodi, 2013.) He was born in 1941 at the northern foot of the Alps in southern Germany. (Famous Graphic Designers, 2019.) and he was best known for his approach to type and design witch then lead on to the revolutionized and rigid traditions of Swiss graphic designs. 
    Wolfgang Weingart was best known as a typographer and graphic designer who was the father to the “new wave” typography in the early 1970 which then this also doubled in to “Swiss punk” (Jodi, 2013).  </p> 
    
   <p>Wolfgang became a big figure in the new typography movement. He moved away from strict grid systems and formal layouts to introduce a more dynamic expressive approach such as 
    layering distorted type and asymmetry this is all aimed to conveying emotion and to help break free from the constraints of functionally. 
    Wolfgang thought in the complete freedom and richness of people's minds and used different arrangements for some different textures and to be more fragmented from some of his other work from his Swiss counterparts. 
    (Jodi, 2013). </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2 id="His work"> His work </h2>
    
    <p>When he worked for new wave, he created the new wave typography in the early 1970s.
         Witch is also known as Swiss punk. Weingart also got his name from how he experimented through his work,
          and it helped him mould the Swiss typography we know now. </p>
    
    <p>Wolfgang Weingart's "New Typography" method, which transformed the use of typography in design, is his most well-known creation.
         His work at the Basel School of Design, where he impacted a generation of graphic designers and typographers, is one of his most notable accomplishments,
         even though he has produced numerous classic pieces. </p>

     <p>Weingart's work on experimental typography in the 1970s and 1980s is among his most well-known and significant endeavours. 
       He is renowned for subverting the strict guidelines of Swiss typography by fusing the accuracy of the Swiss style with more dynamic, expressive layouts and typefaces. 
        His work frequently pushed the limits of the interaction between text and visuals by utilising unusual typefaces, such as overlapping letters, 
        warped forms, and asymmetrical compositions. </p>

        <p>Some of Wolfgang Weingart's most well-known pieces are his Swiss posters, which mark a significant turning 
            point in the development of graphic design. Weingart revived Swiss poster design by fusing the old with the new and is f
            requently linked to the movement away from traditional Swiss Modernism and towards more expressive and experimental 
            types of design. His posters were revolutionary because they used composition, typographic, 
            and visual communication concepts in previously unheard-of ways. </p>
        <p>In the field of graphic design, Wolfgang Weingart's work is still very respected and influential,
             even though its "popularity" may not be as 
            obvious as that of commercial or mainstream design trends.
             An outline of how his work is currently viewed is provided below </p>

        <p>Wolfgang piece Didact Eurodidac is an evocative piece that captures a vivid intersection of education, technology, and artistic expression.
           Wolfgang's ability to blend these themes into a coherent artistic or conceptual framework is impressive and thought-provoking. Another thing 
           that caught my eye about his work is how he keeps the number off assorted colours so a minimum the one poster 
                 am thinking about how he only uses different shades of black and white.  </p>
    





    <h2 id="How he started for new wave "> How he started for new wave </h2>
    
    <p>Wolfgang started up the new wave graphics in Basel himself in Switzerland in the late sixties. He challenged the traditional rules of modern graphics.
         He done this by manipulating typographic relationships and subverting the rigid regularities of the grid (New, 2019) </p>
    

      <p>Wolfgang would frequently use lithographs in his work. the Swiss style was the most popular style.
         During Wolfgang's time, one of the most widely utilised styles was popular typography. The same method utilised for Swiss style was applied in a lot of work. 
         Thus, they were influenced by his work, which explains why there are many parallels between Swiss and new wave styles. 
        [Anon, 2003] </p>
           
    <p>Wolfgang Weingart is frequently credited with "fathering" or at least playing a significant role in the New Wave movement, 
        especially because of his revolutionary use of layout and typography. 
        Weingart's work and instruction were crucial in forming what became known as New Wave Typography, 
        or Swiss Punk, even if the name "New Wave" embraces a variety of influences and movements.  </p>
